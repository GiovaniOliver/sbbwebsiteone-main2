# Enhanced Specification Template

_Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-Level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy the High and Mid-Level Objectives._

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** [Name or short description]
- **Summary:** [Brief summary of what the project is about and why it is being built]

## 2. High-Level Objective
- **Goal:** [High-level goal – what do you want to build?]
- **Intended Users / Audience:** [Who benefits from this project? Who is using it?]

## 3. Mid-Level Objectives
- **List of Concrete Objectives:**  
  - [Objective #1]  
  - [Objective #2]  
  - [Objective #3]  
- These objectives should be measurable and clearly define the steps toward achieving the high-level goal, but not be too detailed. Save specific instructions for the low-level tasks.

## 4. Use Cases & User Stories *(Optional)*
- **Primary Use Cases:** [What are the primary scenarios in which the app will be used?]
- **User Stories:**  
  - **As a [type of user], I want [some action], so that [benefit].**
  - **As a [type of user], I want [some action], so that [benefit].**

*(Add as many user stories as needed.)*

## 5. Implementation Notes
- **Important Technical Details:** [What are key technical considerations or constraints? E.g., frameworks, architecture]
- **Dependencies and Requirements:** [What libraries, APIs, or services will the project depend on?]
- **Coding Standards and Style Guides:** [What coding style or standards should be followed? (e.g., PEP8, ESLint config, etc.)]
- **Security / Privacy Considerations:** [Any data security or privacy requirements to note?]
- **Performance Requirements:** [Any performance benchmarks or constraints to keep in mind?]
- **Other Technical Guidance:** [Any other notes that would help developers or contributors?]

## 6. Context
### 6.1 Beginning Context
- **Existing Files:** [List out any files or code that already exist]
- **Existing Data / APIs:** [Any existing data sources or APIs to integrate with?]

### 6.2 Ending Context
- **Target Files / Outputs:** [List all files that will be created or updated by the end of the project]
- **Desired Final Structure:** [Describe the final directory or code organization]

## 7. Low-Level Tasks
_Ordered from start to finish, each task should outline the specific steps or prompts needed to achieve the mid-level objectives._
